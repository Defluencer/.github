# Defluencer Protocol

Defluencer is a protocol built on top of the inter-planetary file system (IPFS). On IPFS, data is ***content addressed*** which means your content can be shared but never modified. As content go viral, it is ***replicated*** by anyone who reads, watches or interacts with it in any way, resulting in social media without central servers.

Social media content is cryptographically signed. By doing so, each piece of content becomes ***verifiable***.

Websites or applications folowing the protocol become ***interoperable*** with each other because of the properties above.
